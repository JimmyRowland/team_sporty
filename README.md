## Project Description
The target audience for this project is aimed at the sports-related public, such as managers, coaches, and players. SPORTY is a web app that allows individuals to manage their teams/sports organization, and also allow players to connect with other players within their own team or with teams outside their own. With team pages, personal schedules, and personal pages, we aim to make it easier for users to stay in touch and be updated with their team.

## Project Task Requirements (Updated)
After we evaluated our progress on the project, we have reimagined our plan. As a result, we decided to reallocate goals that were underestimated or overestimated in difficulty and removed some goals that were either overly time-consuming or less relevant.
