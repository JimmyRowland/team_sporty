## Project Description
The target audience for this project is aimed at the sports-reltaed public, such as managers, coaches, and players. The goal is to design a web app that allows individuals to manage their teams/sports organization, and also allow users to connect with other users within their own team or with teams outside of their own. Most of the data will be all user-inputted data such as schedules, rosters, informations, etc. With this data, we aim to make it easier for users to stay in touch and be updated with their team. Some addition features that we potenitally aim to accomplish is also create a recruiting portal and a social feed, to make it possible for users to look at or follow things outside of their own team.
